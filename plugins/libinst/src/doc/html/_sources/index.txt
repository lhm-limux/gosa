Welcome to the libinst documentation!
=====================================

.. _libinst:

The libinst library provides an abstraction for three base components needed for
system deployment and config management:

 * Repository management

   This abstraction layer manages software releases based on distribution, components
   and packages. It is possible to work on certain versions of a release. Basically
   this can be a management for debian or redhat packages - or maybe even OPSI products.

 * Base install

   The base installation takes care of installing the very basic os stuff on a
   target system in order to go on with *Config management* later on. The ordinary
   way is to boot via TFTP/fts and load into an OS installer like debian preseed,
   redhat kickstart, opsi or FAI. The base install keeps a set of unified parameters which
   configure the used base install method.

 * Config management

   The config management takes care of doing *everything else* left after the
   base installation: install remaining packages, setup the configuration, etc.

   How the config management takes place varies and should be initiated by some
   process in the base installation - normally the installation of the *gosa.client*
   which can take care of doing the right thing.

   Methods could be puppet, FAI, opsi, etc. which get some level of abstraction
   thru an item concept.

In combination with the *gosa.client*, libinst is going to cover the complete client
lifecycle.
